# Paws for a Cause ([Live Link](dhyaan1.github.io/codezilla2024))

A static website against animal cruelty that we ([Dharmisht](https://github.com/dragn0id), [Dhyaan](https://github.com/Dhyaan1), [Hrishik](https://github.com/fringewidth), and [Kusha](https://github.com/silver-shadow)) hacked together in four hours for an inter-collegiate front-end website building competiton, and won :)

Uniquely, it tries to bring a different perspective to many of the things we take for granted, namely:

- Stray Animals
- Animal Consumption
- Animal Skinning for fashion

with interactive components written in React and good ol' Vanilla CSS.

We also provided some (non functional) features to adopt pets from shelters and donate to prevent animal cruelty.

We used Tailwind, ShadCN and FramerMotion to provide a nice UI that ties everything together.
